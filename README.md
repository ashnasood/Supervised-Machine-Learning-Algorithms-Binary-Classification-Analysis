# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Binary-Classification-Analysis

Adapting the framework from the Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil 2006 paper (CNM06), this report is a replication of the analysis performed to investigate various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and compare their respective performances on multiple binary classification problems. This is a modified replication of the CNM06 paper as I will only be comparing four different Supervised Machine Learning algorithms -- Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forests, and utilizing the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC), Accuracy, and F1 score as the metrics to evaluate model performance across four different datasets. After finding the optimal hyperparameters using grid search, each trained model was evaluated with the three performance metrics and ultimately the Random Forests models outperformed the other algorithms, similar to the results in the CNM06 paper.
